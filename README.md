# Scott's Variety Shop Webpage
A web app that is Scott's Variety Shop LLC's storefront. 

## Background
Since the shutdown of the eBay store under the name luvinthetaco, we aim to create a new and custom storefront to update customers on any news, new items, and anything else that comes to be. 

The source code will be written in Python, with Flask and SQL for the database.  

## Features
Current features that will be implemented are:
- Integration from Facebook to fetch recent posts
- Products page with checkout options (Square and PayPal)
- Admin login to do frontend modifications (mainly for products)
