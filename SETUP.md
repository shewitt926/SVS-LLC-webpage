# Setup
Please start with reading the `requirements.txt` file, as it has the resources necessary there. Most of the resources used can be downloaded with a simple python package install.

Such as (for Windows)
```python
$ python3 install flask
...
$ python3 install flask-login
...
$ python3 install sqlite3
```
